Our own discovery process convinced us that the eGuarantee platform could provide advantages to our clients – not just for routine leasing but also when transacting real property assets. By working collaboratively with the eGuarantee team and our clients, we've been able to help develop legal drafting solutions to allow landlords and tenants alike get on with the job of leasing up, occupying and transacting commercial premises.",
